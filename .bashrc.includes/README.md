Files placed in this dir can be sourced, one of two ways. 
Files prepended by PRE- will be run automatically before the stuff in PRE in .bashrc.local, 
stuff in POST- will run after the POST stuff in .bashrc.local.
Scripts prepended with neither can be sourced normally, perhaps through 
.bashrc.local
