Ben&#39;s Mega Bashrc

Originally from http://www.users.on.net/~boyd.adamson/boyds.bashrc
I have made many modifications

.bashrc.local includes pre and post stanzas 
which get run after the main .bashrc runs. 
Good Things happen after that. You define 
Good Things per-box.

Run install-bashr.sh to (safelyish) install this.
